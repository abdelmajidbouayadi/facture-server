Authentication nestjs
(you can read the documentation )


1/first learn the documentation in nestjs about security 
2/watch this  youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_L225zpUK0M&ab_channel=MariusEspejo


I use Authentication in nestjs:

 We'll start with the first requirement: authenticating a user.
 We'll then extend that by issuing a JWT.
 Finally, we'll create a protected route that checks for a valid JWT on the request.

 1/First we need to install the required packages. Passport provides a strategy called passport-local that implements a username/password authentication mechanism, which suits our needs for this portion of our use case.
 $ npm install --save @nestjs/passport passport passport-local 
         //we use strategy passport-local if you use 
         //if you use other strategy declare it    
 $ npm install --save-dev @types/passport-local // this provides assistance while writing TypeScript code.
